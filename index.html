        <h1>Smaugust Dragons</h1>
        <p>In August 2021 I participated in a month long drawing challenge in which participants had to make a dragon every single day based on the prompt for that day. Although I did not complete the entire month, the dragons I did create for that month were ones I was fairly proud of.</p>

        <p>In October 2021 I also participated in another month long drawing challenge with similar rules to the Smaugust challenge.  However, this drawing challenge was cut off even earlier than the first due to the school semester kicking off. Although it was cut short I did enjoy doing the few prompts I did complete.</p>

        <h1>Storyboards for "The Snow"</h1>
        <p>During my 2022 spring semester at LSU I had the priviledge to be the storyboard artist for a short film in my Virtual Production class.  I worked hand in hand with the director of the short film to visualize her script.</p>
