        <p>This dragon was the first of the prompts and I knew what I wanted to do instantly.  I gave it purple ghostly flames and a face to match.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <img src="img/golden.png" alt="">
        <h2 class="title">Golden</h2>
        <p>This dragon I tried my hand at giving a little personality.  I didn't want to go with a generic "golden" scaled dragon like everyone else.  Instead I went with a small bird-like dragon that stole bits and baubles, simialr to how crows are in real life.</p>

        <h2 class="title">Kaiju</h2>
        <p>I wanted to give this dragon the feeling of being massive without drawing any background so I angled the view to be facing upawards at it.  There are definitely some pacific rim inspirations for this dragon and I am really proud of the "presence" I was able to give this one.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <img src="img/nautical.png" alt="">
        <h2 class="title">Nautical</h2>
        <p>For this dragon I tried to consider it's function in a fantasy world plagued by dragons, something that would threaten every ship that sailed the open seas.  So I thought of a dragon where its chin would resemble a hull breaker, ramming itself into ships and watching them helplessly sink into the sea.</p>

        <h2 class="title">Gothic</h2>
        <p>I was very self indulgent with this dragon and it was by far my favorite dragon for this drawing challenge.  I wanted a dragon that looked like it couldnt fly but didn't really need to, as it stalked its prey at night.  I took a lot of vampire and wendigo imagery with this one.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <img src="img/plague.png" alt="">
        <h2 class="title">Plague</h2>
        <p>For this one I wanted to make a dragon that looked like its mind and body wasn't its own.  I was heavily inspired by the clickers from the last of us for this one.  Something about a brainwashing fungus is really cool to me.</p>
