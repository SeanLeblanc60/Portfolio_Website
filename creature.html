        <h2 class="title">Coven</h2>
        <p>I tried to play with lighting with this one.  Having the light of the cauldron cover the three witches that surround it.  As for the witches themselves, I tried to invoke a sense of just stumbling upon this in the middle of the jungle, far away from society.</p>

        <h2 class="title">Decapod</h2>
        <p>At first I had a mental block with this prompt.  As much as crustacians appeal to me I had a mental block.  I then had the idea of making it an artifact rather than a creature itself.  Perhaps something that wasn't a creature itself but had the means to acess one.</p>

      <div>
        <img src="img/glutton.png" alt="">
        <h2 class="title">Glutton</h2>
        <p>For this one I wanted to stray away from the typical depictions of gluttony, a large bulbous creature.  So insead I tried to make something a little more frail looking but upon closer inspection was something ravenous.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <img src="img/spine.png" alt="">
        <h2 class="title">Spine</h2>
        <p>Going into this one I knew that I wanted a massive spinosaurous looking spine.  However, when I got to the body I couldn't think of what to do.  What I ended up doing was making it look like some sort of mutation from "The Thing" and I think that it turned out really well.  It is just concise enough to kind of look like a creature while still looking like a strange hybrid creature.</p>

        <h2 class="title">Titan</h2>
        <p>I wanted to make a giant manta ray looking thing that carried mountains on its giant back.  I also wanted to make it look like it was a gentle giant carrying a colony of some sort within its mountains.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <img src="img/undead.png" alt="">
        <h2 class="title">Undead</h2>
        <p>I wanted to make a more humanoid undead creature but I still wanted to make it deformed in some way.  So what I decided to do was a mummy-like creature with its body bisected straight down the middle.</p>
