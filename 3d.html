          <p>In my first 3D modeling class we only had one assignment for the whole semester. The assignment was to create an isometric space with models we made ourselves.  Everything in this image I modeled and textured myself.  It was a very long process but at the end of the day it gave me a lot of experience and put my foot in the door for 3D modeling.<p>

          <img src="img/chest.jpg" alt="">
          <h2 class="title">Chest</h2>
          <p>In my second 3D modeling class the class was more focused on modeling and texturing characters.  However, this was assigned to us to see how closely we could model an object based off of an image. I was pretty proud of how this chest came out in the end.</p>

          <h2 class="title">Cyclops</h2>
          <p>This was our first full 3D model we were judged "harshly" on in my second 3D class.  There are some obvious issues with the texturing however I really liked how this one turned out.</p>

        <div>
          <img src="img/lich.jpg" alt="">
          <h2 class="title">Lich</h2>
          <p>This was my last 3D model I have made as of yet.  The purpose of this was similar to the chest where we had to model off of a reference.  This model was almost 1 to 1 with the image I used as reference and I was extremely proud of this.</p>
